# CSSE4011: Connectivity - Serial Console

## **1.0 Motivation**

The following tutorial will cover the implementation of a Shell (command line interface - CLI), within Zephyr RTOS

## 1.1 Test Hardware

> Arduino Sense Board

> mUSB Cable

## 1.3 Setup

Connect the Arduino sense board to the host machine and ensure that the development environment has access to the device (USB passthrough to virtual machine).

**This implementation is valid for Zephyr RTOS Version 2.7.XX**


## **2.0 Zephyr Shell Implementation**

## 2.1 Config Options

## 2.2
