# CSSE4011: Tute 5.2 - Thread Communication 

## **1.0 Motivation**

The following tutorial aims to introduce inter-thread communication (ITC), and useful communication primitives within Zephyr RTOS. 

## 1.1 Inter-Thread Communication (ITC)

Similar to inter-process-communications (IPC) in typical operating systems, ITC allows one thead to share data between another thread(s). Where mutexs and semaphores are typically used for mutual exclusion and signalling, data passing/ITC allows for threads to communicate beyond primitive signaling. 

## **2.0 Thread Communication in Zephyr**

## 2.2 Data Passing in Zephyr

## 3.0 **Tutorial Question**

> 2. Implement an ITC primitive that informs either the on/off thread the total on/off duration time of the led
